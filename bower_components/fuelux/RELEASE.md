# Releasing Fuel UX

## Build



## QA

1. Import release into Fuel UX site (drop release into /node_modules/)
1. Run `gulp release` to push to dev
1. Go through ever single page on http://fuelux-dev.herokuapp.com
    * Scroll to the bottom of each page scanning for visual errors
    * Make sure right-hand nav functions correctly
    * Click on the "base" example of each control on the control pages and make sure it functions
    * Pay special attention to any controls that were modified in the release, look at each example and interact with it to make sure there are no obvious issues
